      <!-- The "{{ }}" is called interpolation. You use this syntax between tags and
      you can show properties that are part of the object in the js file and the value 
      of that property will be shown in the html. You can also use "v-bind" on attributes 
      such as in an href in the html: <a v-bind:href='https://mylink.com'>. The 
      shorthand for this is to actually leave the "v-bind" portion of it off as seen below.
